Build Bee Hotels for Solitary Bees

I am creating Bee Hotels for my Eagle Scout Service Project for Boy Scout Troop 330 in Campbell; this repository contains the build instructions. Bee Hotels provide nesting space for solitary bees. The over 200 species of solitary bees are the native bees of North America, they don't produce honey but are great pollinators for plants and trees. They are unlikely to sting, only if their life is in immediate danger.
